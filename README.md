# ArtViewer

An android app that uses the [art institute of chicago](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction) API

This application was built to test out hilt and dependency injection, bottom app bar navigation and api pagination using the android pagination3 library.
The application also makes use of room so that users can favourite artworks to view later and retrofit for the api service.

The ui of the application is really ugly and i have not spent much time on it as it wasn't a focus.
